Coursework for CPSC 231 for the University of Calgary. This is made up of small weekly exercises plus 5 larger assignments.

### Assignment 1 - Analytic Geometry

Working with Turtle Graphics in Python. Given data representing a circle and a line segment, display them, determine if there is any intersection, and display them if they exist. Assignment was given with sample data files formatted as follows:
 - Xc, Yc
 - r
 - X1, Y1
 - X2, Y2

Where the first two lines are the coordinates of the center of the circle and its radius, and the last two lines are the coordinates for the endpoints of the line segment.
