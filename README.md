# Introduction to Computer Science for Computer Science Majors I

Coursework for CPSC 231 for the University of Calgary. This is made up of small weekly exercises plus 5 larger assignments.

### Assignment 1 - Analytic Geometry

Working with Turtle Graphics in Python. Given data representing a circle and a line segment, display them, determine if there is any intersection, and display them if they exist. Assignment was given with sample data files formatted as follows:
 - Xc, Yc
 - r
 - X1, Y1
 - X2, Y2

Where the first two lines are the coordinates of the center of the circle and its radius, and the last two lines are the coordinates for the endpoints of the line segment.

### Assignment 2 - Chasing Alice

A simple game again using Turtle Graphics. You control a turtle named Alex who has to catch another turtle named Alice. Turns for movement alternate. Alice can turn left or right 90°, or move forward 20 pixels. Alex can turn left or right 45°, or move forward or backward 30 pixels.

Running the file opens the game in a new window with a blank console. Moves are input into the console, and enter must be pressed to register each move.

### Assignment 3 - AI Training

A Game of Nuts: some number of nuts are on a table. Two players take turns picking up between 1 and 3 nuts. The player who has to pick up the last nut from the table loses the game.

This game can be played with:
* Two human players, each taking turns entering their choice into the console
* A human player and an untrained AI player that effectively makes their choices randomly
* A human player and a trained AI player. To play this, the AI first plays 100,000 practice games with another AI. Each AI records a probability table to tell them the move with the greatest chance of winning the game given the current number of nuts on the table.

This game is text-based and played from the console.

### Assignment 4 - The Object of the Game

A Rush Hour clone, playable in a text-based or graphical version. The folder contains a readme with details for operation. 5 sample game setup files are provided and playable.

### Assignment 5 - Semantic Similarity

An intelligent system that learns to answer questions about similarity of words. It processes a large amount of text and build semantic vectors for every unique word that appears in the text based on the other words that appear in the same sentence. When taking the test, the program compares the vector of a given word with the vectors of 2 other choices and calculated which choice is more similar in meaning to the given word. 

The folder contains a readme with details on the accuracy and runtime.

### Exercises

These are very small programs or just functions that were assigned as weekly practice. Details of functionality for each submission are included in the relevant file.

## Extra Credit

This is additional work I've done outside of what was required for the course, done only to for my own learning.

### How to Design Programs Exercises

Short warmups and practices from the textbook How to Design Programs, First Edition.

### Practices

Longer practice problems done as extra assignments.
