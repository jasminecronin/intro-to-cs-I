Chapter 12, exercise 2

a) How many functions are in the math module?

	There are 44 functions in the math module.

b) What does math.ceil do? What about math.floor? (hint: both floor and ceil
	expect floating point arguments.)
	
	math.ceil returns the smallest integer value that is greater than or 
	equal to the input. Ex. 8.5 returns 9
	
	math.floor returns the largest integer value that is
	smaller than or equal to the input. Ex. 8.5 returns 8
	
c) Describe how we have been computing the same value as math.sqrt without
	using the math module.
	
	Taking the square root of a number is the same as raising that number to
	the exponent 0.5. So without the math module, we can find the square root
	of a number x with the operation:
			x ** 0.5
	
d) What are the two data constants in the math module?

	The two data constants are:
		e = 2.718281828459045
		pi = 3.141592653589793
		
	There is also a third:
		tau = 6.283185307179586
	but tau is simply 2pi, so it's not a totally separate data constant.
