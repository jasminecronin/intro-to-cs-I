# Introduction to Computer Science for Computer Science Majors I

## Assignment 1 - Analytic Geometry

This program reads in 7 values: the x- and y- value for the center of a circle and its radius, and the x- and y- values for two points that lie on a line. The program uses turtle graphics to draw the defined circle and line to the display. It will then compute the intersections of the line and circle, if any, and display them as well. The assignment uses elements of the Python programming language including variables, expressions, statements, functions, and conditional expressions.

## Assignment 2 - Chasing Alice

This is a turn-based game where the player controls a blue turtle, Alex, to chase and catch a red turtle, Alice.

## Assignment 3 - AI Training

An introduction to machine learning using The Game of Nuts. In the game, there is a pile of nuts on a board and two players. On each turn, a player picks up 1 to 3 nuts. The one who has to pick up the final nut will be the loser. The program can be played with two human players, a human against an untrained AI, or a human against an AI that has been trained against another AI.

## Assignment 4 - The Object of the Game

A simple implementation of a Rush Hour game. This program was an introduction to programming a game loop and a graphical user interface.

## Assignment 5 - Semantic Similarity

This program learns how to answer questions that ask the user to pick a synonym of a word out of a list of alternatives. The AI builds a dictionary of semantic similarity, which is a measure of closeness of the meanings of words. Synonym questions are then administered to the trained AI.
