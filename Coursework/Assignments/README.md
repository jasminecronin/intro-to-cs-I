## Assignment 1 - Analytic Geometry

This program reads in 7 values: the x- and y- value for the center of a circle and its radius, and the x- and y- values for two points that lie on a line. The program uses turtle graphics to draw the defined circle and line to the display. It will then compute the intersections of the line and circle, if any, and display them as well. The assignment uses elements of the Python programming language including variables, expressions, statements, functions, and conditional expressions.
